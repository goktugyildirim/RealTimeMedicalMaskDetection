# RealTimeMedicalMaskDetection

<p> Real Time Medical Mask Detection using OpenCV and PyTorch: </p>
<p> This repostory contains two IPython Notebook file: </p>
<p> 1) <strong> Masked_Unmasked_Classifier: </strong> I developed a PyTorch model that can classify if the face carries the medical mask or not, by performing a transfer learning concept on the pre-trained ResNet-50 model. This model was tested with 576 different pictures and achieved %99 accuracy.</p>

<p> 2) <strong> Masked_Unmasked_Detection: </strong> This file performs real-time detection by using a pre-trained Haar Cascade model from the OpenCV module and PyTorch model that was developed by me. </p>
